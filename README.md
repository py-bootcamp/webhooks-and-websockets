# Websockets and Webhooks in Python

Here you can find some code snippets of my presentation about websockets and webhooks in Python.

`Tested with Python 3.8`.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
# to run the server
uvicorn main:app --reload


# to trigger the webhook
curl localhost:8000/trigger

# to launch a local web server to serve index.html
python -m http.server 5000
```
